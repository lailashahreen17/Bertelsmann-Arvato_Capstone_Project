# Bertelsmann-Arvato_Capstone_Project

## Project Motivation
This project applies Machine Learning algorithms to get information about potential customers out of demographic data. It is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree and shows the main steps to solve the underlying business needs: data understanding, data preparation, modelling and evaluation. The data and outline of this project was provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary. I had an opportunity to practice and showcase my unsupervised and supervised machine learning skills and complete the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree capstone project. While brushing off my skills, I also had learn to optimize my coding structures to minimize run time and save memory space.

The whole project was divided into four parts:

> In Part 0 the provided data is read in and all necessary Data Preparation steps are done.

> In Part 1 the demographic data of the companyâ€™s existing customers and the general population of Germany are compared with each other. Therefore unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of a mail-order company.

> In Part 2 another dataset with demographic information for targets of a marketing campaign of the company is provided. To predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company supervised learning techniques are applied.

> In Part 3 the supervised learning model built in Part 2 is used to predict the response of a testing data set. This prediction is used to compete in a Kaggle competition. 

Finally the results were summarized in a Medium blog post found here:
